# CSC-121 M1HW1 â€“ Miles Per Gallon
# Dustin Cooksey
# This project calculates miles per gallon for a driver
# using multiple tanks of gas for a trip.

def Main():
    
## Set the inital test for the loop and
## get input from the user.
    
    overallMPG = 0
    total_Gallons = 0
    total_Miles_Driven = 0
    gallons_Used = float(input("Please enter the gallons " 
                              "used or -1 to terminate: "))
    
## Test for the condition to run the loop.    
    
    while gallons_Used > 0:
        
## Get the rest of the needed input from the user.
        
        miles_Driven = float(input("Please enter the amount"
                                   " of miles driven: "))

## Perform your calculations.
         
        mpg = miles_Driven / gallons_Used
        
## Print the information calculated
         
        print("The miles/gallon for this tank was", mpg)

## Keep a running count of the totals for 
## miles driven and gallons used.
        
        total_Gallons = total_Gallons + gallons_Used
        total_Miles_Driven = total_Miles_Driven + miles_Driven
        
## Give the user the option to exit out of the loop
## or run the program again.
        
        gallons_Used = float(input("Please enter the gallons"
                                   " used or -1 to terminate"))
## Calculate the total MPG for the driver.
        
    overallMPG = total_Miles_Driven / total_Gallons
    
    print("Your total average miles/gallon was", overallMPG)
